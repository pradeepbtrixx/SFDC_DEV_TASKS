The following trigger prevents the deletion of an account if it has related opportunities. 
By default, deleting an account causes a cascade delete of all its related records. 
This trigger prevents the cascade delete of opportunities. 
Try this trigger for yourself! If youâ€™ve executed the previous example, 
your org has an account called Apples & Oranges with a related opportunity. This example uses that sample account.

trigger AccountDeletion on Account (before delete) {
   
    // Prevent the deletion of accounts if they have related opportunities.
    for (Account a : [SELECT Id FROM Account
                     WHERE Id IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity) AND
                     Id IN :Trigger.old]) {
        Trigger.oldMap.get(a.Id).addError(
            'Cannot delete account with related opportunities.');
    }
    
}

trigger AddRelatedRecord on Account(after insert, after update) {
    List<Opportunity> oppList = new List<Opportunity>();
    
    // Add an opportunity for each account if it doesn't already have one.
    // Iterate over accounts that are in this trigger but that don't have opportunities.
    for (Account a : [SELECT Id,Name FROM Account
                     WHERE Id IN :Trigger.New AND
                     Id NOT IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity)]) {
        // Add a default opportunity for this account
        oppList.add(new Opportunity(Name=a.Name + ' Opportunity',
                                   StageName='Prospecting',
                                   CloseDate=System.today().addMonths(1),
                                   AccountId=a.Id)); 
    }
    
    if (oppList.size() > 0) {
        insert oppList;
    }
