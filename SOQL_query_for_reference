The following trigger prevents the deletion of an account if it has related opportunities. 
By default, deleting an account causes a cascade delete of all its related records. 
This trigger prevents the cascade delete of opportunities. 
Try this trigger for yourself! If youâ€™ve executed the previous example, 
your org has an account called Apples & Oranges with a related opportunity. This example uses that sample account.

trigger AccountDeletion on Account (before delete) {
   
    // Prevent the deletion of accounts if they have related opportunities.
    for (Account a : [SELECT Id FROM Account
                     WHERE Id IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity) AND
                     Id IN :Trigger.old]) {
        Trigger.oldMap.get(a.Id).addError(
            'Cannot delete account with related opportunities.');
    }
    
}
